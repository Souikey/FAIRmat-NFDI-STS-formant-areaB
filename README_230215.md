# Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS)
[STS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_spectroscopy) was developed following the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to probe surface electronic structure. Employing a sharp tip on a substrate, current (I) curves are measured without scanning, usually as a function of voltage (Bias Spectroscopy, I vs V or simply I/V curves) [G. Binnig et al. in Physical Review Letters](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.991). A correct measurement of such curves enables the intepretation of the material's bulk or interfacial electronic and vibrational structure. Additionally, curves can be recorded per x,y pixel leading to a I/V, dI/dV and d<sup>2</sup>I/dV<sup>2</sup> mapping or microscopy [R. J. Hamers et.al. in Physical Review Letters](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.56.1972). 

## Spectroscopy type: Bias Spectroscopy (Out of several types)
## I/V, dI/dV and d<sup>2</sup>I/dV<sup>2</sup> curves
Today, I/V curves are recored by means of a phase senstive detection device, such as a lock-in amplifier. Depending on the correct usage of the lock-in amplifier, this enables the user to approximatelly measure the dI/dV and d<sup>2</sup>I/dV<sup>2</sup> data as output of the lock-in amplifier instead of nummerically deriving I/V. 

The following are the parameter set involved in STS. Most parameters are recorded during measurment employing the SPECS Group GmbH Nanonis BP5e (not in the order read by the BP5e software)

- Lock-in>Modulated signal	Bias (V)	1E-3 # Applied bias voltage. To modify the bias you can either enter a value in the digital display or move the slider.


- Integration time (s)	150E-6 # Time during which the data are acquired and averaged.
- Bias Spectroscopy>Number of sweeps	100	 # Number of sweeps to measure and average.
- Bias Spectroscopy>Sweep Start (V)	-300E-3  # The first bias values of the sweep.	
- Bias Spectroscopy>Sweep End (V)	300E-3	 # The last bias values of the sweep.
- Bias Spectroscopy>Num Pixel	4096	# Define the image resolution. 
- Bias Spectroscopy>Z Avg time (s)	100E-3 # Duration over which the Z position is recorded and averaged before and after the sweep (the latter only if Record final Z position is selected in the Advanced section). After the initial Z averaging time, if Z-Controller to Hold is selected in the Advanced section, the Z-Controller is set to hold and the tip is placed at the previously averaged Z position (plus Z offset).
- SoftwareMain>RT Frequency (Hz)	20E+3	# 
- SoftwareMain>Signals Oversampling	10	# (Signals Periods) The Signals Period is the rate at which the signals are transferred to the host computer running the control software. This is usually lower by a factor of 10 than the sampling rate, because an internal oversampling of the signal is done on the real time engine. You can reduce the oversampling down to 1 in order to resolve higher frequencies in the Spectrum Analyzer.
- SoftwareMain>Acquisition Period (s)	20E-3	# Update rate for several processes like History Graph, Auto-Approach, and for many Programming Interface functions. This is usually set to 20 ms. All additional timings (7-9) can only be integer multiples of this value. They can be set to different values, but the actual timing value will be coerced to a multiple of the Acquisition Period.
- SoftwareMain>Animations Period (s)	20E-3	# Update rate of animated graphical indicators. These are e.g. some graphs & sliders. A reasonable value is 40 ms (25 updates per second). Increase this period to reduce the processor load for the graphical user interface, especially on slow computers. This value is purely a user interface update rate and does not affect measurements in any way.
- SoftwareMain>Indicators Period (s)	300E-3	 # Update rate of digital indicators, e.g. the numbers displayed besides each slider. Here, 3 updates per second, or 300 ms is enough. This value is purely a user interface update rate and does not affect measurements in any way.
- SoftwareMain>Measurements Period (s)	500E-3	# The Measurements period is the integration time for precise measurements (averaging over specified period), mostly used in sweep modules. Examples are recording of a force-distance curve or a resonance of a cantilever. For fast measurements with small steps, a value of 40 ms may be reasonable. For normal use, 300-500 ms is a good value, but for recording a resonance of a high-Q cantilever, values of several seconds might be necessary. Usually this parameter doesn’t need to be set from this module; the sweep modules will set this value according to the sweep timings.
